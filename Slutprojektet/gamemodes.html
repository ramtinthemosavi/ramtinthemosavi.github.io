                  <h1>Game Modes</h1>
                  <p>
                     In <span style="color:#45BF00">Town</span> of Salem, there are eight different game modes to play in the game; Classic Mode, Ranked Practice, Ranked, Custom Mode, Rapid Mode, All Any, Rainbow Mode, and Vigilantics.
                     In every game mode except Custom Mode and Rapid Mode, the game will start automatically when the lobby reaches 15 players.
                     There are also Coven equivalents to all modes, and a new Coven VIP mode, Coven Lovers Mode, and Coven Rivals mode.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Classic Mode</h1>
                  <p>
                     Classic Mode is the simplest form of the game; the roles are predetermined. This mode is geared towards newer players so they can learn roles without them changing every other game.
                     The amount of roles depend on the number of players. The corresponding number will be the first roles that are used. For example: if there are 10 players only the first 10 roles will be used. This means that if there are twelve or fewer players, there will be no uncertainty to what roles are in the game, as there will be no Town Killing or Random Town.
                     The Town should press everyone for claims. If two people claim the same role, one is either the Random Town or an evil role. If 2 groups of two people claim the same role (for example, two people claim Sheriff, and two other people claim Doctor) one of them is definitely evil. The same goes if 3 people claim the same role, or if 2 people claim the same role is the Random Town slot. is dead. Once the Random Town is known, it is easy to narrow down who is evil by process of elimination. If you are evil, claim a role that fits in your investigation result that is hard to disprove and provide a will to back your claim up. If the Investigator dies and didn't put your investigation result in your will, you can claim any role. Be careful of counterclaims though, normally, the one with a better will is the one who stays alive. If you are a Jester, you should try and claim what a confirmed Town claims. Most people will likely believe them over you. If you are an Executioner, claim Sheriff or Investigator and accuse your target late game.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Ranked Practice</h1>
                  <p>
                     This mode may be found under the 'Normal' tab and it features the same role list which Ranked Mode has.
                     10 games of this mode are required to play Ranked.
                     Players may play this mode with friends in a party.
                     This mode is often played by players that need to warm up before a Ranked match.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Differences</h2>
                  <p>
                     In order to participate in Ranked matches, you must have played and have completed 50 games in other Game Modes. You must also have completed 10 Ranked Practice matches, which counts towards playing 50 games.
                     You will be competing to win and earn Elo.
                     Rather than being placed into a lobby, you are placed into a queue that redirects you to a ranked match with fourteen other people. You will see a timer instead of the 'Play' button on the top of the screen, with the words 'Ranked Queue'. When the timer runs to 0, you will be shown a small picture with 2 options: 'Accept' and 'Decline'. Choose 'Accept' to join the queue. WARNING: If you wait too long, you will get a message telling you that the queue is already full but you will be the first person in the next queue.
                     The roles are predetermined (see below for list of player roles).
                     Scrolls are not allowed in this game mode,[1] because the developers wanted scrolls to have no effect on Ranked games and have a fair environment to play without them.[2]
                     Parties are not allowed in this game mode, as you are sent right into the queue.
                     Since there is more claimspace in Ranked, it becomes easier for the evils to claim freely. If you are Town, it is usually best to have a confirmed Townie that directs the Town on what to do. They should ask for claims and narrow it down that way. However, this has a downside in which it forces Jailor and other important Town roles to claim. If a Townie is confirmed, make sure you have a Transporter, Lookout, Bodyguard, Doctor, or even a Jailor on them. The Town should communicate with each other in the day time to gain information. If you are evil, try and lay low and attack semi-confirmed Townies, or ones that might be important and have no protection. However, once the Random Town or Any slot is known, it makes claiming significantly harder and can lead to Town's victory.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Ranked Regular</h1>
                  <h1>Custom Mode</h1>
                  <p>
                     Custom Mode gives the Host more freedom to choose what they want to put into their game. All players will earn the same number of Merit Points, which is dependent on the duration of the match.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The Host</h2>
                  <p>
                     The host is the first person who joins the lobby. If there are at least 7 players in the lobby, players are able to type /repick to pick a new host which will be one of the players in the lobby. You would also be needed to be in the lobby for at least 10 seconds before repicking the host.
                     The host can create the role list from 15 choices of any specific or random role. Random roles may be of a certain alignment (e.g. Neutral Killing), a certain team (e.g. Random Town) or Any.
                     The host has a few restrictions while picking roles:
                     There cannot be more than one of a Unique role.
                     There cannot be more than five members of the <span style="color:#DD0000">Mafia</span>.
                     There cannot be more than four Vampires.
                     There cannot be more than three Any roles.
                     There cannot be more than six of a particular role or role type.
                     For common setups to host, view Custom Setups.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Rapid Mode</h1>
                  <p>
                     Rapid Mode is a Game Mode where everything is fast-paced. The timer for several aspects of the game is cut in half, leaving you with much less time. If you need a quick game or a fast-progressing game, then this is where you'll find it. All players will earn the same number of Merit Points, which is dependent on the duration of the match.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Differences</h2>
                  <p>
                     Time given to complete actions is cut in half.
                     Overall duration of the game is decreased.
                     Certain roles drop in usefulness (see Disadvantages)
                     It is possible to start with as little as two players as long as they are of opposing factions.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Advantages </h2>
                  <p>
                     Great for people who want to play a game but don't have enough time.
                     Great for people who like fast progression.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
                  <p>
                     Night and Defense phases progress very fast.
                     Less amount of time to write your Last Will.
                     Difficult to find a match, as it is not as popular as other game modes.
                     Some role abilities are put at a disadvantage with the shortened time frame (ie. Medium's seance and the Jailor's jailing).
                     Difficult to discuss with each other.
                     Harder for Forgers to forge Last Wills.
                     Shorter time to choose what you are going to do at night.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Strategy</h2>
                  <p>
                     Rapid Mode forces players to summarize their findings as fast and as succinct as possible. Interrogations are also forced to speed up. Players who are able to summarize accusations can effectively carry the game and steamroll over the rest of the town. However, just like Custom, the strategy depends on the role list.
                  </p>
                  <h1>All Any</h1>
                  <p>
                     All Any mode is completely random and consists of 15 Any slots, which can be any of the 33 roles in the game. As with other modes, there can only be one of each Unique Role if one is selected. Games can start with as many as 5 members of the Mafia and, although very rare, as few as 0 members of the Mafia. Games can also start with up to 4 Vampires.
                     Normally, the Mafia have a big majority over the rest of the factions. They are the usually only faction that knows their identities instantly, while the Town can take many days to figure out who is who. If you are accused as any role, call them an <span style="color:#ACACAC;">Executioner</span>. If you are evil, you should refrain from claiming Jester because that is a common claim for evils in this mode. The Town have to converse and figure out the role list very quickly before the evil roles kill them all of or the Vampires convert them all.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Strategy</h2>
                  <p>
                     All Any mode requires players to only rely on the findings of their own and other people. As such people who rely on the role list to make accusations may be at a disadvantage.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Advantages</h2>
                  <p>
                     It is significantly easier for Neutral roles to win games, as chances are that there isn't as many Town roles compared to other gamemodes.
                     Members of the Mafia may also find it easier to win as they instantly recognize their teammates.
                     Games generally take a short time to start as it is popular among Town of Salem players.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Rainbow Mode</h1>
                  <p>
                     Rainbow Mode is a chaotic game mode where the role list looks like a rainbow. Arsonists, Serial Killers, and the Godfather are night immune, as well as any potential Survivors and Veterans on alert.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Strategy</h2>
                  <p>
                     Mafia Edit
                     Main Ally: Witch - Witches can stop the evil Serial Killers from killing your Mafioso, Arsonists from killing you, and only have a 50% chance to affect you.
                     Night Kill Target: Amnesiac - Amnesiacs likely will join the Arsonists or Serial Killers. They cannot become you, and they're not night immune, so target them.
                     Lynch Target: Arsonists - Sure, the Serial Killers can kill your Mafioso, but you can try to trick them later in the game. Arsonists can kill both of you, and are the ultimate threat of the game, able to kill everyone.
                     Arsonists Edit
                     Main Ally: Other Arsonists - The best team you have is your own. You can kill anyone, and as soon as someone is doused, you can ignite them later or even in the same night for quick deaths. Arsonists can collaborate through Death Notes on when to ignite, who to douse, etc.
                     Night Kill Target: Town - They're your bane. If either of them still can use their ability in an endgame, they win. The Jailor can kill you early, and the Veteran just wants to save themselves from attacks, not mass-kill.
                     Lynch Target: Mafia - If you're not killing members of the Mafia at night, lynch one of them. An informed group can be very powerful towards the endgame, and if it's 2 versus 1 or 3 versus 2, you're doomed. Also, Survivors and Witches will likely side with them.
                     Survivors Edit
                     Get your name out there. The longer you wait, the less believable your claim is. Keep reminding people, and they won't want to hurt an ally.
                     Note: if you claim to be a Survivor on the first day, someone may try to kill you on the first night, but you can use a bulletproof vest to keep yourself safe.
                     Town Edit
                     Main Ally: Survivors - Survivors will probably go with the side that wins the least in the endgame, so team up with them. The Mafia could work too, as you can easily win in a 1 versus 1, and an Arsonist if you aren't doused. Remember that because the Town doesn't have the majority, you will need any ally you can get to compensate for your lack of Night Immunity.
                     Night Kill Target: Serial Killers - They make the most nightly kills of any faction, and the longer they live, the more likely you are to die. Also, Serial Killers in jail will kill the Jailor if said Jailor doesn't execute them.
                     Lynch Target: Mafia - You need one lynched in order to win in the endgame with them, so think long-term.
                     For Veterans, it's best to start using alerts after Night 1, constantly or on most of the nights, since Rainbow Mode is full of evil roles. Once you're out of alerts, you can ask Jailor to jail you. Don't write your name in your Death Note; perhaps you should put another player's name in your Death Note, because you'll most likely be lynched if you write your own name.
                     Amnesiacs Edit
                     You have 2 tactics:
                     Be peaceful - Remember that you were a Witch or Survivor, claim you're that person, be helpful to everyone you can.
                     Steal the win - If an Arsonist dies Night 2 or 3 with something from 10 or less people alive, become an Arsonist. The other Amnesiac will likely do too, and you will have a power group. If they aren't dying, remember that you were a Serial Killer. You still have an effective faction that can take the majority and kill the Town and a Mafioso.
                     Serial Killers Edit
                     Main Ally: Survivors - They have bulletproof vests, they won't be that afraid of you, especially if you vow you won't attack them. Witches will likely mess up your killing flow to protect themselves, but they work when it comes to voting.
                     Night Kill Target: Town - You have a Veteran, trying to save himself from being shot, and can be in a 1 versus 1 with you in the endgame, which is a gamble. You also have a Jailor that can kill you literally or passively through Last Wills, and you will likely be lynched because only Survivors and Witches win with you. Kill them off as fast as you can, but be cautious of alerts.
                     Lynch Target: Arsonists - They're the only faction bigger than you. They can kill everyone, including you, they have the same numbers as you, are in your case in the endgame, are basically you but stronger in this setup. You can get an easy lynch out of them as they're prime targets to kill. It's a long-term plan that will help in the endgame.
                     Witches Edit
                     Claim and confirm yourself as a Survivor, and pretend to do what Survivors do, remind people constantly. You can convince Jailors not to execute you because you aren't the primary kill. People can have good games because since the Jailor might already die, so you can tell them not to execute you as you are the least priority target. In order to win the game, its best if you tell the Mafia you're a Witch and team up with them before they kill you.
                     Any: Edit
                     Jester/Executioner Edit
                     What people lynch on varies between games, so that can change. However, Executioners can claim on stand, and people will probably lynch the Town, or if you want to be subtle, just put one vote on someone. For Jesters, become an annoyance that people just dislike and want out of the game. Don't spam, as that's breaking the rules, but being annoying all varies on how you feel, (Ex. Name, Spoiling a Movie, Unpopular opinion on Politics/games/movies, etc).
                     Werewolf Edit
                     Main Ally: Witches - If you communicate, you won't be threats to each other, and to be safe they can control you every other night. Survivors will probably fear you because of your killing ability.
                     Night Kill Target: Town - Veterans tend to attract attention, and if you attack them when they aren't alerting, you can get a bunch of kills in, but you have to read when they're alerting correctly. Also, them alerting in endgame is incredibly bad. Jailors can out you like Serial Killers, and they can kill you in endgame. Also, you probably want to avoid attention unless you want to stay home for some reason.
                     Lynch Target: Arsonists - They can douse you, ending your Night Immunity and devastate your life if they ignite. In a 1 versus 1, a draw will come out as they will ignite you and you will maul them, creating a draw.
                     Vampire Edit
                     Try to bite the Town for less threats and Amnesiacs so you don't have a big role against you. You can even try to persuade the Jailor to get bitten if you want. Survivors and Witches will probably side with you for this rare occurrence. Everyone who you can't bite though, except for Witches, are lynch targets, as they're in a factions that can kill you.
                     Vigilantics Edit
                     The goal of Vigilantics is for one team, either Vigilantes or Witches, to kill the opposing team at night to win. Witches want to force Vigilantes to kill other Vigilantes, and Vigilantes try to shoot or lynch the Witches. If a Vigilante shoots another Vigilante, both will die, as the original shooter will commit suicide after murdering a Townie.
                     Strategy Edit
                     It is a game of risk, chance, and luck. The most effective way to rid of Witches is by lynching them and hoping you guess correctly. There is little strategy to this Game Mode, other than pointing your barrel in the right direction.
                     However, as a Witch, there is a certain strategy that you can take. Choosing a random person and sending them to another person can result in a Vigilante killing one of your fellow Witches. To avoid this from happening, you can have the person visit themselves. This can result in nothing happening, in which case you have found a Witch and can team with them. If it's a Vigilante, they kill themselves. The only downside to this is that you cannot achieve a double Vigilante kill which comes from a Vigilante killing another Vigilante, and then they die for killing a Townie.
                     If you are a Vigilante put your name in your Death Note, so if you do kill a Witch you will be a confirmed Vigilante, even though a Witch might make you shoot yourself the next night which would be the downside of that, and even if you do kill a Vigilante you are confirmed so take the most of that and rally people to random lynch, as that's your best chance of winning.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Diffrences</h2>
                  <p>
                     Up to 10 Vigilantes and 5 Witches are picked, rather than a diverse set of characters.
                     The tendency for less players leads to faster games.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Advantages</h2>

                     Luck-based (advantage for some, not for others).
                     If you're a Witch, you won't die from being controlled by another Witch to target yourself.

                     The game is very much based on luck. If you shoot the wrong person, you're done for.
                     If you're a Vigilante, you have a very high possibility of either dying by guilt or dying by another Vigilante.
                     Players are scarce, so it will take quite a while to fill up the lobby.
                     If you're a Witch, you cannot defend yourself from being shot by a Vigilante unless you control them.
